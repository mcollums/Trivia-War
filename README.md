 Trivia Wars provides users with the opportunity to learn and compete in a variety of different topics including Music, Math, Geography, and Sports in a fun and dynamic way. Our app incorporates a classic trivia quiz approach, but also provides users with the choice of either a single player or multiplayer mode. In addition to these different game modes, users can register and keep track of their stats and performance with a live leaderboard and stat tracker on the user homepage. The live leaderboard tracks user results in both game modes and reflects cumulative performance, which adds a fun, competitive element to each game played.
